# Hand_Gesture_Based_Gaming




## Overview
This project uses computer vision to create an interactive gaming experience controlled by hand gestures. It leverages the OpenCV library for hand tracking and the PyAutoGUI library to simulate keyboard inputs, allowing users to control games through specific hand gestures.

## Features
Hand tracking using OpenCV to detect and analyze hand gestures.
Simulates keyboard inputs based on detected gestures for game control.
Provides an immersive and hands-free gaming experience.
## How to Use
Run the script.

The camera captures hand movements, and the program interprets specific gestures.

Gestures like a closed fist or an open hand trigger corresponding keyboard commands, enabling game control.


## Requirements

Python,
OpenCV,
cvzone library,
pynput library
